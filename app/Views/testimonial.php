I was quite happy to be associated with him in various causes. The Childwish Foundation was a natural progression of his dreams and work and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. I have contributed my bit by donating to the education of poor children and I have always received the full details of how my donation is being utilized by them. This has motivated me to donate more because I know that my money is being spent wisely on the needy. Vasif has inspired me to do at least one act of kindness every day and I know that this is just the start.</p>

I was apprehensive at first. But they showed me the details of the projects they are associated with and their work till now. I was quite impressed with their dedication and commitment to such a noble cause. Also, Kanaiyalal Jadav has been associated with various welfare schemes even in the past. The best part was that they got back to me after I had donated. They gave me the details of where and how my fund was utilized and how many children have benefitted from it. It was good to see that they are genuine and kind-hearted people who are trying their level best to help the poor children in rural areas. May their tribe increase.</p>

                                <p class="text-color-dark text-5 line-height-5 mb-0">It is such a sad state of affairs in and around villages. It pains to see that so many kids go hungry without food. They do not have access to even basic education. Their health suffers due to acute poverty. I was aware of all these but I never knew how to contribute to their upliftment. When Childwish Foundation approached me with their project, I felt that God had sent them to me. I happily donated some help in cash and kind to one of their project. I was happy to see at least one child benefit from my contribution. The child now regularly attends school and hopes to be a doctor one day. My donation may be small, but I am satisfied that I have done my bit. </p>
